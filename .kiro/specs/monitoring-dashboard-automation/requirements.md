# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a production-style monitoring system that exposes metrics from a Go web service, visualizes them with Grafana, and triggers automated alerts to Slack/Discord when performance thresholds are breached. The system provides comprehensive observability including health endpoints, Prometheus metrics collection, and automated alerting for service reliability monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want a Go web service with health and metrics endpoints, so that I can monitor service availability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL expose a GET /healthz endpoint that returns 200 OK
2. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL expose a GET /readyz endpoint that returns readiness status
3. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL expose a GET /metrics endpoint in Prometheus format
4. WHEN a request is made to GET /api/v1/ping THEN the service SHALL respond with a successful ping response
5. WHEN a request is made to GET /api/v1/work with ms and jitter parameters THEN the service SHALL simulate work for the specified duration
6. WHEN the service receives requests THEN it SHALL instrument all HTTP requests with Prometheus metrics including route, method, and status labels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want comprehensive metrics collection, so that I can monitor service performance and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN the system SHALL record http_requests_total counter with route, method, and status labels
2. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN the system SHALL record http_request_duration_seconds histogram with route and method labels
3. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL expose go_goroutines gauge metric
4. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL expose process_cpu_seconds_total counter metric
5. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL expose process_resident_memory_bytes gauge metric
6. WHEN work jobs are in progress THEN the system SHALL record work_jobs_inflight gauge metric
7. WHEN work operations fail THEN the system SHALL increment work_failures_total counter metric

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want error injection capabilities, so that I can test alerting and monitoring systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/v1/toggles/error-rate with valid admin token THEN the system SHALL enable/disable error injection
2. WHEN error injection is enabled THEN the system SHALL return 5xx errors at a configurable rate
3. WHEN accessing admin toggle routes THEN the system SHALL require bearer token authentication
4. IF no valid admin token is provided THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want a complete Docker Compose observability stack, so that I can run the entire monitoring system locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN docker-compose up is executed THEN the system SHALL start go-app, prometheus, grafana, alertmanager, node_exporter, and blackbox_exporter containers
2. WHEN Prometheus starts THEN it SHALL scrape metrics from the go-app service every 5 seconds
3. WHEN Prometheus starts THEN it SHALL scrape metrics from node_exporter and blackbox_exporter
4. WHEN Grafana starts THEN it SHALL be configured with Prometheus as a datasource
5. WHEN Alertmanager starts THEN it SHALL be configured to send notifications to Slack/Discord webhooks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want automated alerting, so that I can be notified when service performance degrades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service instance is down for 2 minutes THEN Alertmanager SHALL fire an InstanceDown alert
2. WHEN 5xx error rate exceeds 2% for 10 minutes THEN Alertmanager SHALL fire a HighErrorRate alert
3. WHEN p95 latency exceeds 0.5 seconds for 10 minutes THEN Alertmanager SHALL fire a HighLatencyP95 alert
4. WHEN uptime probe fails for 3 minutes THEN Alertmanager SHALL fire an UptimeProbeFail alert
5. WHEN alerts fire THEN Alertmanager SHALL send notifications to configured Slack/Discord webhooks
6. WHEN alerts resolve THEN Alertmanager SHALL send resolution notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want comprehensive Grafana dashboards, so that I can visualize service metrics and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display a Service Overview panel showing service up/down status
2. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display requests per second metrics
3. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display error percentage over time
4. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
5. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display Node CPU and Memory usage
6. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display Blackbox probe success rates
7. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display top routes by latency
8. WHEN Grafana loads THEN it SHALL display recent alerts panel

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want load testing and demo capabilities, so that I can validate the monitoring system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load testing scripts are executed THEN they SHALL generate sufficient traffic to trigger latency alerts
2. WHEN error injection is toggled THEN it SHALL generate sufficient errors to trigger error rate alerts
3. WHEN a service container is stopped THEN it SHALL trigger instance down and probe failure alerts
4. WHEN demo scenarios are run THEN all alerts SHALL fire and resolve correctly
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN dashboards SHALL reflect the increased traffic and resource usage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer/operator, I want proper configuration management, so that I can customize the system without hardcoded values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults or fail gracefully
3. WHEN webhook URLs are provided THEN Alertmanager SHALL use them for notifications
4. WHEN admin tokens are configured THEN the system SHALL use them for authentication
5. IF sensitive configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be provided via .env file and not committed to repository
